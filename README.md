# Boss Machine

Once you have the project downloaded, you'll need to run some terminal commands to get the application started. First, open the root project directory in your terminal. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies of this project and build the front-end application. Once it has finished installing, you can run `npm run start` to begin your server. You'll see `Server listening on port 4001` in the terminal. The `npm run start` script will automatically restart your server whenever you make changes to the **server.js** file or **server/** folder. If you want to turn this off, simply start your server with the `node server.js` command. You can kill either process with the `Ctrl + C` command.
